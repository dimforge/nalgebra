//! ## Matrix Market format
//!
//! The Matrix Market format is a simple ASCII-based file format for sparse matrices, and was initially developed for
//! the [NIST Matrix Market](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/), a repository of example sparse matrices.
//! In later years it has largely been superseded by the
//! [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection](https://sparse.tamu.edu/) (formerly University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection),
//! which also uses the Matrix Market file format.
//!
//! We currently offer functionality for importing a Matrix market file to an instance of a
//! [CooMatrix](crate::CooMatrix) through the function [load_coo_from_matrix_market_file],
//! as well as functionality for writing various sparse matrices to the matrix market format
//! through [save_to_matrix_market_file]. It is also possible to load
//! a matrix stored as a string in the matrix market format with the function
//! [load_coo_from_matrix_market_str], or similarly write to a string with
//! [save_to_matrix_market_str].
//!
//! Our implementation is based on the [format description](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html)
//! on the Matrix Market website and the
//! [following NIST whitepaper](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/reports/MMformat.ps):
